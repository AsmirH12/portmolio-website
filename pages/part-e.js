                    <p><b>Main topics studied</b></p>
                    <p>Over the course of this unit, I explored various concepts and topics with the overarching goal of understanding how matter can be quantified on the atomic scale. I first got exposed to the mole - a very large number that we can group elementary entities in. I learned how the mole can be used with molar mass to act as a bridge between the small world of particles to the big world of mass, allowing us to determine the mass of any number of atoms, elements, formula units, or molecules. I then stumbled across percentage composition by mass, and learned how it can be used to determine empirical formula and in turn, molecular formula. Following that, I learned about how the mole can be used to express the concentration of a solution as moles per unit volume, which is referred to as molarity. I then learned how the concept of molarity can be used to perform dilutions through the dilution equation. I then investigated gasses and explored the relationship between pressure, volume, temperature, and moles. I synthesized these relationships into the various gas laws, namely Avogadro’s Law, Charles’ Law, Boyle’s Law, Guy-Lessac’s Law, the Combined Gas Law, and the Ideal Gas Law. I also explored the distinction between real gasses and ideal gasses. I subsequently learned about molar volume, which is the volume occupied by a mole of a gas, and how it is 22.7 L/mol at standard temperature and pressure. I then delved into stoichiometry and discovered how to quantify chemical reactions through coefficient ratios and predict the number of reactants and products in a given reaction. I witnessed how the equations I learned before that involved moles can be integrated into stoichiometry problems to predict the amount of reactants and products. My learning wasn’t limited here; I explored the concepts of limiting reactants, excess reactants, theoretical yield and actual yield, and learned how to determine the percentage yield of a reaction. </p>

                    <p><b>Problem solving strategies</b></p>
                    <p>The first problem solving strategy I developed was dimensional analysis. This technique involves including units in calculations and multiplying by conversion factors to convert between units. Since this unit heavily involved quantities and conversion between units, dimensional analysis proved to be very useful both to organize my answers and ascertain that they are correct. I could reassure myself that my answers were correct because I could see if some of the units in my dimensional analysis canceled out to yield the desired unit asked for in the question. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Another problem solving strategy I used was stating the givens in a problem before tackling it. Often, just by looking at the question, it is not obvious what approach is the best and what equations should be used. By stating out givens, however, I was able to clearly lay things out and the equations and methods the problem would entail became more apparent to me. As well, I was able to organize and structure my answer more effectively. This was particularly useful in ideal gasses problems, where there are often many variables and equations to choose from. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>I also broke problems down into simpler, more manageable chunks and solved each piece to eventually put them together and arrive at the solution. I employed this extensively in the stoichiometry unit. For example, I had to calculate moles of reactants given information about concentration, mass, or gas properties, which was often the first step. I then used the number of moles and coefficient ratios to predict products, identify limiting reactants, and/or determine theoretical yield and percentage uncertainty. By working systematically and breaking these sorts of problems down into sequential steps, I was able to efficiently solve them in an organized, structured way. </p>

                    <p><b>Why is it important to understand concepts dealing with quantities in Chemistry?</b></p>
                    <p>It is important to understand concepts dealing with quantities in chemistry for a variety of reasons. Firstly, particles are incredibly small. It is unfeasible to count every particle in a substance, and this is why it is especially important to understand the concept of moles - the foundation of quantitative chemistry. Moles allow us to better conceptualize the amount of particles and enable us to work with their tiny nature so we can relate them to the big world of mass. Furthermore, quantities allow us to better predict scenarios in the real world. Whether it is calculating the amount of products formed in a reaction, determining the volume of solvent needed to perform a dilution, or calculating the final pressure of a gas, quantities let us predict final values and explain real world phenomena accurately. Additionally, quantities in chemistry fosters safety. In the case of stoichiometry, we are able to use numbers and ratios to calculate the amount of both reactants and products, ensuring that no dangerous amount of any substance is present. In solutions, we use concentration to ensure that there is not too much solute in a volume of solvent, which is especially important when dealing with acids. </p>

                    <p><b>Traditional test or portfolio?</b></p>
                    <p>I believe I would do better on a portfolio over a traditional unit test. In tests, I tend to make many smole mistakes, like plugging in the wrong numbers, performing calculations wrong, and misreading questions. As well, there is a time constraint which I have to be wary of which exacerbates these mishaps and sometimes prevents me from checking over my work. In a portfolio, these impeding elements are gone because I have as much time as I want to look over questions and ensure everything is correct. As well, portfolios give me the chance to better demonstrate my knowledge and go above and beyond and pursue topics that interest me. </p>
